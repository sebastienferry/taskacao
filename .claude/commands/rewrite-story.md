# Rewrite Story

Stage: -> .

## Goal
Reformat a task's title, description, and optional comments into a clean GitHub-Flavored Markdown specification (User Story: As a..., I want..., So that... + Context + Acceptance Criteria + Notes).

## Read first
- The task: title, description, and task comments (if requested or passed as context).
- Standard GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) formatting guidelines.

## Steps
1. Inspect the task title, raw description, and comments (if provided).
2. Extract the core intent, user value, technical context, and acceptance criteria.
3. Generate a structured GFM document containing:
   - **User Story**: As a <role>, I want <feature>, So that <benefit>.
   - **Context**: Problem background and technical overview.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Checkbox list (- [ ]) of verifiable functional & non-functional requirements.
   - **Notes**: Extra technical details or risks mentioned in comments.
4. Output the reformatted markdown directly for preview and user confirmation.
