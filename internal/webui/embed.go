// Package webui carries the compiled interface inside the binary.
//
// A single file that needs nothing beside it is the difference between a program
// one distributes and a program one installs. The interface is therefore built
// into internal/webui/dist and embedded from there: go:embed cannot reach above
// its own package, which is why the build output lives here rather than in web/.
//
// The embedded copy can legitimately be empty, when the binary is built without
// building the interface first. FS reports it, and the server then falls back on
// serving the files from disk, which is what the development loop does anyway.
