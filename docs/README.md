# Taskacao Architecture & Engineering Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive technical documentation for **Taskacao** (the Autonomous AI Task & Project Orchestrator). This documentation is designed to provide complete architectural clarity, component blueprints, data specifications, and step-by-step instructions so that any software engineer or Large Language Model (LLM) can understand, maintain, extend, or completely re-implement this system from scratch.
